# RocketLauncher
A project for shooting specified objects with UNPOWERED projectiles automatically. Like shooting airballons with a modified LEGO-RocketLauncher. The Launcher itself with three servomotors is controlled with an Arduino via serial port. The Camera can be any camera available on your PC. The whole project is cross-platform compatible (could ba an RaspberryPi with Camera too). Current Status: Building up.
